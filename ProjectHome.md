Sometimes I write little bits of Perl code to do handy things.  I'll dump them here.

1. My employer and I bear no responsibility if they do not do what you expect them to, or cause any damage.

2. You may distribute and use this code as long as you do not remove my copyright. I work for the Canadian Government and technically they own the copyright, even if I give you all rights to use the code. Americans - yes, our rules are different to yours.

I think I should alter all of the fasta apps to do the same things to sequences in fastq format.
